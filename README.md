## Project Description 
This project originated when I was developing a dashboard screensaver for my TV, intended to be hosted on a Raspberry Pi. The goal was to showcase daily news, weather updates, stock information, and more. I desired interactive functionality, allowing me to click and navigate through menus without using a mouse. Inspired by Iron Man, I envisioned the capability to gesture in the air to control and command the dashboard.

## My Contributions
Recognizing the necessity for machine vision, I took the initiative to self-educate on TensorFlow, the creation of landmarks, and their tracking. I developed a demo project to deepen my understanding of TensorFlow and its applications.

## Results 
I successfully designed several distinct modes for this project. The initial mode generates a mesh overlay on a face, highlighting landmarks. The second mode determines the count of raised fingers, while the third mode calculates the pixel distance between two fingers. The fourth mode identifies body landmarks, and the fifth mode focuses on facial recognition.
